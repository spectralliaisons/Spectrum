Spectral Analysis in Python
â€¢ Analyzes spectrum across entire sound file

* supports many file types; all converted into mono wav format since analysis can vary depending on encoding
* 'What is the sound's characteristic frequency?'
		-> calculates 'weighted spectral centroid': weighted by total energy of sound across the duration of the entire sound 
* graphs spectrograms across time by energy and spectral change (std of a frequency bin as its energy changes over the duration of the sound)

HOW TO USE
python test.py

or

import Spectrum as s
a = s.Analyze('sound/kombucut.wav', maxFreq=8)
a.plot()
